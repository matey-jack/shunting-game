I didn't record the first few prompts. The were roughly:
 * "create the app according to spec in .md file."
 * "make the sidings and head shunt fixed length with a fixed divider." ==> this was basically a fix of something not clear in the spec.
 * level solving animation and follow-up dialog. ==> I completely forgot this in the spec. A senior dev would have added it by themselves. :-D

Remaining prompts were:

"make it so that the app after running "vite build" can be pushed to GitHub and be hosted automatically on github.io"
==> I didn't use what it made here and instead copied one line of code from my other project.
